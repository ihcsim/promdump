  description: |
    promdump dumps the head and persistent blocks of Prometheus. It supports
    filtering the persistent blocks by time range.

    promdump is a tool that can be used to dump Prometheus data blocks. It is
    different from the 'promtool tsdb dump' command in such a way that its output
    can be re-used in another Prometheus instance. And unlike the Promethues TSDB
    'snapshot' API, promdump doesn't require Prometheus to be started with the
    '--web.enable-admin-api' option. Instead of dumping the entire TSDB, promdump
    offers the flexibility to filter persistent blocks by time range.
